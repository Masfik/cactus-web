# 🌵 Cactus Web Client 🌐
**Cactus** is a content-sharing application that allows people to consume different types of material (videos in particular) collectively with friends — **remotely** and in a synchronised fashion using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/). Users can also control the media content as if they were in the same physical room.

**⚠ This app is still in development and unstable!**<br><br>

Current features include:
- Authentication with Firebase
- Searching users and adding friends
- Switching between rooms 
- Starting a screen-sharing session (audio included)
- _Chatting with friends (WIP)_
- 🌚 Dark & Light theme 🌝
